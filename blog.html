                        <div class="accordion-body p-5"><b>What is Session Storage?</b> <br>

                            Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
                            difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not
                            expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. <br>

                            A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions
                            are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the
                            tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new
                            session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session
                            cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own
                            sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied
                            to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
                            objects. <br>

                            A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data
                            stored by scripts accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) <br> is stored in a
                            separate object from the same site accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com).
                            <br> A
                            DOMString number is two bytes per character in UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are
                            automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. <br>

                            Session Storage has 4 methods: <br>

                            setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It
                            is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key. <br>
                            sessionStorage.setItem(key, value) <br>
                            getIteam() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the
                            value stored with a particular key name.<br>
                            sessionStorage.getItem(key) <br>
                            removeItem() Method – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in
                            reference to key. <br>
                            sessionStorage.removeItem(key)
                            clear() Method – This method is used to clear all the values stored in the session storage
                            sessionStorage.clear() <br>

                    <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingTwo"

                        <div class="accordion-body p-5">a scope is where you can refer to a variable. a block defines a
                            block scope a variable defined inside a block will be defined only inside that block and you
                            can't reference it after the end of block. <br>

                            so in this code if you try something like: <br>

                            <code>
                            x = 10;
                            if(x ==10) { // start new scope
                            int y = 20; // known only to this block
                            x = y * 2;
                            }

                            y = 5; // error y is out of scope, not it is not defined
                         </code>
                            <br>
                            because what you have here is a local scope <br>
                            other kinds of scope in java are class scope (for example), a member of a class has a class
                            scope so it is accessible anywhere inside a class. <br>

                            the basic rules for scope are: <br>

                            The scope of a parameter declaration is the body of the method in which the declaration
                            appears. <br>
                            The scope of a local-variable declaration is from the point at which the declaration appears
                            to the end of that block. <br>
                            The scope of a local-variable declaration that appears in the initialization section of a
                            for statement’s header is the body of the for statement and the other expressions in the
                            header. <br>
                            A method or field’s scope is the entire body of the class. This enables non-static methods
                            of a class to use the fields and other methods of the class. <br>

                            <b>I am thinking about it and this is what I came up with:</b> <br>

                            Let's see this code below: <br>

                            <code>  console.clear();
                            console.log("a");
                            setTimeout(function(){console.log("b");},1000);
                            console.log("c");
                            setTimeout(function(){console.log("d");},0);</code>
                            A request comes in, and JS engine starts executing the code above step by step. The first
                            two calls are sync calls. But when it comes to setTimeout method, it becomes an async
                            execution. But JS immediately returns from it and continue executing, which is called
                            Non-Blocking or Async. And it continues working on other etc. <br>

                            The results of this execution is the following: <br>

                            <b>a c d b</b> <br>

                            So basically the second setTimeout got finished first and its callback function gets
                            executed earlier than the first one and that makes sense. <br>

                            We are talking about single-threaded application here. JS Engine keeps executing this and
                            unless it finishes the first request, it won't go to second one. But the good thing is that
                            it won't wait for blocking operations like setTimeout to resolve so it will be faster
                            because it accepts the new incoming requests. <br>

                            But my questions arise around the following items: <br>

                            #1: If we are talking about a single-threaded application, then what mechanism processes
                            setTimeouts while the JS engine accepts more requests and executes them? How does the single
                            thread continue working on other requests? What works on setTimeout while other requests
                            keep coming in and get executed. <br>

                            #2: If these setTimeout functions get executed behind the scenes while more requests are
                            coming in and being executed, what carries out the async executions behind the scenes? What
                            is this thing that we talk about called the EventLoop? <br>

                            #3: But shouldn't the whole method be put in the EventLoop so that the whole thing gets
                            executed and the callback method gets called? This is what I understand when talking about
                            callback functions: <br>

                            <code>function downloadFile(filePath, callback)
                                {
                                blah.downloadFile(filePath);
                                callback();
                                }
                            </code> <br>
                            But in this case, how does the JS Engine know if it is an async function so that it can put
                            the callback in the EventLoop? Perhaps something like the async keyword in C# or some sort
                            of an attribute which indicates the method JS Engine will take on is an async method and
                            should be treated accordingly.
